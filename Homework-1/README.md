## Homework-1
- Setup a scene - make a level with the assets that are given.
- Make a player character and give him the ability to move.
- Make a camera follow script - The task is to write a script that will make the camera follow the player. Bonus points if you can make the following motion smooth.
- Ground Detection - The task is to write a script that lets the player jump. Jumping is allowed only if the player was previously on the ground (otherwise he would be able to jump to infinity).
- Dropping Platforms - It's pretty self-explanatory. When you jump on it it must drop down.
- Moving Platforms - Right or left. Up or down. As you wish.
- Pick Ups - In the asset package there is a key. Use this key and when the player move through it it will disappear. Output something in the console.
- Power Ups - Make a jumping pad or something similar.
- Return player to starting position when falls out of map.
