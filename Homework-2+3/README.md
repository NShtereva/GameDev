## Homework-2
- Healthbar - with 3-4 hearts.
- UI for Pickups - When you pickup a key, to register it with the UI.
- Main Menu - Play, Exit, Options (doesn't need to have option button functionality).
- Shader - When you are on low health (1 heart) to set a red vignette shader or Screen shake with shader, NOT BY MANIPULATING THE CAMERA POSITION / Blur when you are hit or whatever you like.
- Animate Player States - Walk animation, Jump animation, Hurt animation and if you want some other animation.
- Simple AI for Enemy as seen in the first screenshot - Make the AI aggressive when the player is near.

- Controller support.
- Do at least one of the following tasks (Bonus points if you do both! (^_^)):
    - Procedurally generated levels - You can have one level as an introductory level and after that all levels will be generated. You can either try:
        - To use dynamic generation of platforms while you play.
        - To generate in advance the whole level.
        - something else?
    - Multi-player:
        - Sync movement and animations.
        - Distinct players by showing players' names above their heads like "Player1", "Player2", etc.
        - Make a winning condition like who gets first to the top or the first to get a key.
        - Show all players who is the winner.
